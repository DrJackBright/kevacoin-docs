1. [What is Kevacoin?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

   The name "Keva" is an abbreviation of key-value (pronouce Kee-Va). It is a key-value store built on blockchain, on the codebase of Bitcoin and Litecoin. Besides being a cryptocurrency(KVA), it allows users to easily and securely add, update or delete key-value pairs on the blockchain.

   Kevacoin is hugely influenced by Namecoin, with the key-value part of the code modified from Namecoin's name registration code.



2. [What is it different from Namecoin?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

   Even though Kevacoin is hugely influenced by Namecoin, it serves very different purpose than Namecoin:
   * Kevacoin is a key-value store, while Namecoin is a name registration system.
   * Kevacoin has no hard limit on the number of keys, and the maximal length of value is 3072 byte. Namecoin's has 520 byte limit for each namespace.
   * Kevacoin's namespace id uniquely generated by the network to avoid conflicts. Namecoin's namespace is chosen by user and has to be unique across the network. Kevacoin does not need to concern about namespace squatting.
   * Kevacoin's key-value pairs do not expire.

   There are no advantages or disadvanges of above differences. The two coins just need to serve different purposes.

4. [How much does it cost to use Kevacoin data store?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

   Before adding a key-value pair, one needs to create a namespace to hold the pairs. The system reserves 0.01 KVA for the creation of namespace and the amount cannot be spent. One can add key-value to the namespace, with a transaction fee determined by the miners.

5. [Why it is not free to use?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

   Kevacoin is a public blockchain and anyone can write to it. The network vulnerable to spamming abuse without transaction fee. In addition, transactions are validated by validators (miners), and miners need to be compensated for their works.

6. [Where can I get Kevacoin?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

   The easiest way to get Kevacoin is through mining. We provide mining software on Linux and Windows, and support both Nvidia and AMD GPUs. Check [https://kevacoin.org/mining](https://kevacoin.org/mining) for more information.

   The Kevacoin core developers sometimes give away KVA to for the community to try the Kevacoin data store, check [https://kevacoin.org/trial](https://kevacoin.org/trial). Please note that we do not pre-mine any coins. Since we get the coins through mining too, the give-away depends on how many coins we have.

6. [How long does it take to confirm a key-value update?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

    Kevacoin has a block time of about two minutes. Therefore you may need to wait about two minutes before your key-value pair is confirmed and added the next block. You can use the client command <code>keva_pending</code> to check the pending key-value transactions.

7. [What is a namespace, and why do we need one?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

9. [Does Kevacoin support Smart Contract?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

    Kevacoin is based on Bitcoin/Litecoin, so it has the similar level of support for smart contract. Kevacoin is a de-centralized data store and it leaves the implementation of application logic off the blockchain.

    Take the example of de-centralized microblogging system. As long as the user data is written to the data store and is publicly accessible, anyone can write an application (using his/her favorite programming language) to display existing blogs and add new ones. The application can be propreitary or open source, but the content is the same because we have a single source of truth.


10. [What is the maximal key and value size?](https://kevacoin.org/faq#)

    The maximal key size is 255 bytes, and the maximal value size is 3072 bytes. It is hard to balance of

Keva | Key-Value Data Store on Blockchain

What’s Kevacoin?

Kevacoin is the cryptocurrency for the blockchain that supports easy and flexible Key-Value data store. Use it like Redis or other popular data store, except that the data is stored on the public blockchain that is not owned by any entities.

The data store is easy to add, update and access. No programming skills required and it does not required smart contracts and their associated complications and risks.

Use it for publication, microblogging, public identities, notaries, etc.

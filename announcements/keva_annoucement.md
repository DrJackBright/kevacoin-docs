## Keva | Key-Value Data Store on Blockchain

### What’s Kevacoin?

Kevacoin is a cryptocurrency for the blockchain that supports easy and flexible Key-Value data store. Use it like Redis or other popular data store, except that the data is stored on the public blockchain that is not owned by any entities.
